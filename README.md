# Blobs With Guns: Redux

It's my second game, Blobs with Guns, but with a bunch of changes and optimisations to make it playable and remove bloat. Basically, the ideal way to experience the original game.

This version uses Godot 3.4.2. Some things break when using newer versions so I've just kept it here.
